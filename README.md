- Inside of a FOR loop there is generally no visibility
- This tool breaks it down live into rows and columns similar to a spreadsheet
allowing you to visualize, de-mystify and choose the FOR conditions/arguements passed through the loop in realtime
- Has adjustments for input-cmd, skip, delimiters, targeted row/column, testing and creation of the loop
- A rudimentary/complicated tool, but without any visual so are FOR loops
